# smart-factory-predictive-maintenance
A Docker-based simulation of a Smart Factory environment. This project implements a multi-agent system where agents communicate over MQTT to perform predictive maintenance on industrial machinery. The system includes agents for data generation, context processing, AI-driven decision-making, and action execution.
